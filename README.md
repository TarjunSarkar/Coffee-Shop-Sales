# Coffee-Shop-Sales
In this project, I developed an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze coffee shop sales, providing key insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. I utilized several tools throughout the project to ensure data accuracy and clarity.

Data Cleaning and Preparation: I used Power Query to clean and transform raw sales data by removing duplicates, correcting formatting, and handling missing values, ensuring accurate analysis. I removed duplicates, corrected formatting issues, and handled missing values to ensure the data was clean and ready for analysis.

Data Modeling: I also used data modeling to Establish relationships between multiple datasets (sales transactions, inventory, and customer data), enabling a more cohesive analysis.

Interactive Dashboard Development: Created an intuitive Excel dashboard with dynamic charts, including line graphs and bar charts, to visualize sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance in real-time.

Automated Reporting: Streamlined reporting processes, reducing manual data processing by allowing automatic data updates and real-time visualization.
