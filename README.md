# Coffee-Shop-Sales
In this project, I developed an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze coffee shop sales, providing key insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. I utilized several tools throughout the project to ensure data accuracy and clarity. To clean and prepare the raw sales data, I used Power Query, which helped streamline the data transformation process. I removed duplicates, corrected formatting issues, and handled missing values to ensure the data was clean and ready for analysis. I also used data modeling to create relationships between multiple datasets, such as sales transactions, inventory, and customer information, enabling a more cohesive analysis.
